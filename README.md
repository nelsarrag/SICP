# SICP
This repo contains a record of my SICP solutions. I only completed the first of four chapters, but it was a brilliant guide to functional programming and showed me a glimpse of how far one can go with only recursion. Undoubtedly the most difficult and informative CS experience I've ever had. This was self-directed - so it probably would've been a lot smoother with some TAs/professors.

This repo also contains my solutions for the two weeks of Brian Harvey's CS61A course at Berkeley.
