# SICP
This was a self-directed experiment in functional programming primarily using the _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_ book by Abelson and Sussman.  Undoubtedly the most difficult and informative CS experience I've ever had.

This repo also contains my solutions for the two weeks of Brian Harvey's CS61A course at Berkeley.
